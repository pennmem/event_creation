    """
    Runs localized component filtering (DelPozo-Banos & Weidemann, 2017) to clean artifacts from EEG data. Cleaned data
    is written to a new file in the ephys directory for the session. The pipeline is as follows, repeated for each
    EEG recording the session had:

    1) Drop EOG and trigger channels from the data.
    2) High-pass filter the data to eliminate baseline drift.
    3) Split the recording into partitions, separated by mid-session breaks. A new partition begins immediately after
        each mid-session break. Also mark break periods for subsequent exclusion while fitting ICA.
    4) Detect and drop bad channels separately for each partition.
    5) Apply a common average reference to the data.
    6) Run ICA on the data, with break periods and pre- and post-session EEG data excluded from this fitting process.
    7) Use ICA solution to decompose data into its sources.
    8) Remove artifacts from each source using localized component filtering.
    9) Reconstruct the original channels from the cleaned sources.
    10) Use the cleaned data to interpolate the bad channels that were dropped prior to ICA.
    11) Concatenate the partitions of data back into a single, continuous time series.
    12) Save the cleaned session data to a .fif file.

    To illustrate how this function divides up a session, a session with 2 breaks would have 3 parts:
    1) Start of recording -> End of break 1
    2) End of break 1 -> End of break 2
    3) End of break 2 -> End of recording

    Note that this function uses ipython-cluster-helper to clean all partitions of the session in parallel.

        """
        Runs several bad channel detection tests, records the test scores in a TSV file, and saves the list of bad
        channels to a text file. The detection methods are as follows:

        1) Log-transformed variance of the channel. The variance is useful for identifying both flat channels and
        extremely noisy channels. Because variance has a log-normal distribution across channels, log-transforming the
        variance allows for more reliable detection of outliers.

        2) Hurst exponent of the channel. The Hurst exponent is a measure of the long-range dependency of a time series.
        As physiological signals consistently have similar Hurst exponents, channels with extreme deviations from this
        value are unlikely to be measuring physiological activity.

        A third method used to look for high voltage offset from the reference channel. This corresponds to the
        electrode offset screen in BioSemi's ActiView, and can be used to identify channels with poor connection to the
        scalp. The percent of the recording during which the voltage offset exceeds 40 mV would be calculated for each
        channel. Any channel that spent more than 25% of the total duration of the partition above this offset
        threshold would be marked as bad. Unfortunately, this method does not work after high-pass filtering, due to the
        centering of each channel around 0. Because sessions are now partitioned for bad channel detection, high pass
        filtering must be done prior to all bad channel detection, resulting in this method no longer working.

        Note that high-pass filtering is required prior to calculating the variance and Hurst exponent of each channel,
        as baseline drift will artificially increase the variance and invalidate the Hurst exponent.

        Following bad channel detection, two bad channel files are created. The first is a file named
        <eegfile_basename>_bad_chan<index>.txt (where index is the partition number for that part of the session), and
        is a text file containing the names of all channels that were identifed as bad. The second is a tab-separated
        values (.tsv) file called <eegfile_basename>_bad_chan_info<index>.tsv, which contains the actual detection
        scores for each EEG channel.

        :param eeg: An mne Raw object containing the EEG data to run bad channel detection on.
        :param index: The partition number of this part of the session. Used so that each parallel job writes a
            different bad channel file.
        :param basename: The basename of the EEG recording. Used for naming bad channel files in a consistent manner.
        :param ephys_dir: The path to the ephys directory for the session.
