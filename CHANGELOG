2025-10-02
===================
- Added ValueCourierSessionLogParse class for integrating typed value recall into Courier sessions.
- Implemented VALUE_RECALL event creation via add_value_recall.
- Implemented modify_word_with_value_recall to attach typed recall and actual value fields to corresponding WORD events.
- Updated _add_type_to_modify_events to automatically process VALUE_RECALL events without modifying add_value_recall itself.
- Overwrote default modify_store_recall and modify_free_recall to customize handling for value recall sessions.
- Ensured all value recall modifications preserve recarray structure for pipeline compatibility.

2023-7-26
===================
- System 3 and system 4 event creation supported by same codebase
- Added parser for system 4 math events
- Added support for ICatFR and IFR experiments (read only)

2021-6-2 (v2.0.0)
===================
- Moved to Python 3 (following the deprecation of Python 2). Not all legacy experiments are fully supported in Python 3 at this point. All modern UnityEPL experiments are supported. 

2018-11-12 (v1.2.4)
===================
- Removed System3FourAligner from production

2018-10-25 (v1.2.3)
===================
- Added parser for TICL_catFR
- Fixed bug in which TICL experiments could not be processed if artifact detection was not run


2018-8-21 (v1.2.2)
==================

- Simplified eegfile determination for system 3.4 in the case that there's only 1 file
- Corrected name of LocationSearch experiment

2018-8-3
========
- Fixed bug in which only encoding stim events recieved a matching STIM_OFF
  event
- Added support for location_search

2018-7-18
=========
- show_imported_experiments no longer treats experiment names with underscores
  differently


2018-6-27
=========
- Added biomarker values, positions, phases to TICL BIOMARKER events

2018-6-26
=========
- Localization spreadsheet can now be successfully read and inserted
  when any non-alphanumeric character is used as a separator in pair labels


2018-3-28
=========
- STIM_ON and STIM_OFF events now appear in the correct places in (cat)FR6 event structures
- Successfully running the event creation pipeline now sends a request to the web reporting API
- HostPCLogParser now uses the same stim_params fields as everyone else
- neurorad_tasks.CorrectCoordinatesTask now uses `code` instead of `subject` when correcting MNI coordinates

2018-3-6
========
- Refactored event_creation and bundled it into a conda package

2018-1-15
=========
- Added support for PS5, FR6
- both CatFR* and catFR* are acceptible names for catFR experiments (though not PS*_catFR*)
- Added parsers.dtypes module; all experiments with the same name should now create events with the same fields


Outstanding Issues
------------------
- mstime field in events produced by HostPCLogParser do not use a unified clock


2018-1-16
=========
* Added brainshift-corrected MNI coordinates to localization
* Fixed bug in which event pipeline would crash if electrode config file didn't have a name
* Added call to brain visualization API at end of localization pipeline
* Updates to PS4 experiment suite:
    - all_events.json now created for PS4 experiments
    - PS4_* now their own set of experiments
    - anode_label,cathode_label,anode_num,cathode_num,amplitude fields moved from top level of PS4 events to stim_params

2017-12-5
=========
* Added some data quality checks to FR,catFR,PAL events
  - functions defined in quality module
  - parser registers the functions it wants to run in the class attribute _TESTS
  - error messages added to self.pipeline.importer.warnings in EventCreationTask
  - Importer now has warnings attribute, with corresponding changes to Importer.display() and ImporterCollection.display()
* Parsers now crash if they are missing annotation files

2017-10-30
==========
Added new task, math parsers for UnityEPL compatibility


2017-10-20
==========
submission.convenience supports neurorad pipeline

2017-08-24
==========
Added Unicode support where it was missing


2016-10-12
==========

- Some subjects were missing channels of EEG data. This has been resolved.
- Stimulation voltage in PS was sometimes reported in uA, and sometimes in mA.
  Now they will all be in uA
- PS events were occasionally out of order
